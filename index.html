        <h2>Types of General Waste</h2>
        <p>
            General waste can be categorized based on its origin and composition. Understanding these categories helps in proper waste management. Here are the main types of general waste:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Household Waste:</strong> Includes everyday items like food packaging, plastic bags, diapers, and non-recyclable containers. This is the most common type of general waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial Waste:</strong> Generated by businesses, this type includes packaging materials, office supplies, and food waste from restaurants and cafes.</li>
            <li><strong>Industrial Waste:</strong> Non-hazardous waste produced by manufacturing and industrial processes, such as scrap materials, offcuts, and packaging.</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional Waste:</strong> Waste generated by schools, hospitals, and government buildings, including paper waste, food waste, and non-recyclable office supplies.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction & Demolition Waste:</strong> Includes materials like concrete, bricks, and non-recyclable building materials. While some construction waste can be recycled, a significant portion ends up as general waste.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Properly sorting and managing these types of general waste can significantly reduce their environmental impact and promote more sustainable practices.

        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            Managing general waste effectively is essential for reducing its environmental impact. Here are some strategies to help manage general waste:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce:</strong> Minimize waste by choosing products with less packaging, using reusable items, and avoiding single-use plastics.</li>
            <li><strong>Reuse:</strong> Find new uses for items instead of discarding them. For example, repurpose containers or donate old items to charity.</li>
            <li><strong>Proper Disposal:</strong> Ensure that non-recyclable waste is disposed of correctly in designated general waste bins to avoid contamination of recyclables.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Waste Reduction Initiatives:</strong> Participate in community clean-up events, waste reduction programs, and advocacy for better waste management policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By adopting these practices, we can reduce the amount of general waste produced and minimize its impact on the environment.
